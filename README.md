# GlucoSense-v1
GlucoSense is an AI-powered web application designed to predict diabetes noninvasively using breath-based sensor data and physiological parameters. This tool leverages machine learning algorithms to classify individuals into three categories—non-diabetic, prediabetic, and highly diabetic—based on volatile organic compound (VOC) patterns in breath, along with body vitals and demographic details.
